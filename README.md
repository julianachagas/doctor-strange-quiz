## Doctor Strange Quiz

This project is an interactive quiz about the character Doctor Strange from Marvel. It was built to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the Modern JavaScript Course from [The Net Ninja (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/).

When the user submits the quiz the score is displayed with a message which depends on the score obtained.

The `setInterval` method was used to animate the score from 0 to the user's score.
